    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
        Hello, my name is Andrew Lee. I am currently studying Information Technology as
        an undergraduate at the Illinois Institute of Technology. This is my second year
        here at IIT. I was born in Chicago but my hometown is in Morton Grove. IT is a
        field that is always evolving with the evolution of technology and I think it
        leaves a big impact on the world.

    <h3>My hobbies</h3>
    <p>
        My hobbies include playing soccer, building things (legos, chairs, tables, anything),
        surfing the web, and last but not least, playing video games.
